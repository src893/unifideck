# Unifideck Plugin Build Script - new-architecture branch
# 
# This script is responsible for preparing and packaging the Unifideck plugin
# for Decky Loader. It handles both "production" and "development" builds,
# pre-build requirements (like downloading external binaries and compiling
# locale files), and packages the final structure into a .zip file.
# 
# It supports two build strategies:
#   1. Docker/Podman with the Decky CLI (preferred, matches upstream CI).
#   2. Local bash/pnpm fallback (useful for direct Steam Deck builds without containers).
#
# Reflects the 5-layer package restructure (v0.7+)

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e

# Establish absolute paths to ensure script works regardless of where it's called from.

Usage: ./build-plugin.sh [dev|prod] [install|quick-install] [push]

The mode is optional and defaults to dev, so it can be left off entirely.
If you do name one, it must come first.

  dev (default)     development build; stays entirely on this machine
  prod              production build (uses package.json version)

  install           after build, full reinstall to ~/homebrew/plugins/Unifideck
                    (rm -rf + unzip + chown - ~30s)
  quick-install     skip build entirely, rsync source → install in seconds.
                    Use after editing Python / config / bundled binaries.
                    Includes defaults/ so config never drifts. For frontend
                    edits, run `pnpm run build` first to refresh dist/.
  push              dev only: publish the built zip to GitHub as a new
                    "Dev-*" prerelease and retire the previous one. WITHOUT
                    this argument nothing is ever uploaded to GitHub.
  -h, --help        show this message

Examples:
  ./build-plugin.sh                  # local dev zip, no install, no upload
  ./build-plugin.sh quick-install    # fastest deploy to the live plugin
  ./build-plugin.sh install push     # rebuild, install, publish for testers
  ./build-plugin.sh push             # dev build, publish it for testers
  ./build-plugin.sh prod             # release zip in out/

# so the install zip is self-contained and doesn't depend on the
# Loader's pip behaviour.
#
# We download manylinux wheels for Python 3.11 (Decky Loader's bundled
# Python, which runs the plugin backend), regardless of the host's
# Python. ``--only-binary :all:`` refuses sdists so we never accidentally
# compile against the host's libpython.
#
# NOTE: the Steam shortcut launcher (bin/unifideck-launcher) does NOT run
# under Decky's Python - it runs under the *system* /usr/bin/python3, whose
# minor version varies by distro (SteamOS/Bazzite/CachyOS are 3.13 today, but
# CachyOS is rolling and Arch will bump to 3.14). Any ABI-specific C extension
# that a launcher code path imports must therefore be vendored for Decky's
# Python AND every system Python we want to support. Today that's cffi's
# ``_cffi_backend`` (pulled in by cryptography via the cloud-save / token
# paths): see vendor_launcher_cffi(), which loops LAUNCHER_PYTHON_VERSIONS.
# Without a matching .so the launcher now degrades cloud-save gracefully
# (see launcher/dispatcher.py) rather than aborting every game launch.
#
# Idempotent: if a package is already in py_modules/ we leave it
# alone (--upgrade-strategy only-if-needed). Disk-cheap and fast
# (~2s when fully cached, ~10s on first run).

# Vendor cffi's ABI-specific _cffi_backend for the LAUNCHER's Python too.
#
# vendor_deps() above targets Decky's Python ($DECK_PYTHON_VERSION) and so
# only produces _cffi_backend.cpython-311-*.so. But bin/unifideck-launcher
# runs under the system /usr/bin/python3, whose minor version varies by host
# (see LAUNCHER_PYTHON_VERSIONS). The cloud-save / token-refresh paths import
# cryptography → cffi → _cffi_backend at load time; under a system Python with
# no matching .so the import raises and (historically) the launcher aborted:
# killing ALL game launches. cryptography's own binding is abi3
# (version-agnostic) and the rest of cffi is pure-python, so the ONLY
# ABI-specific piece we need for the system interpreter is _cffi_backend.
#
# To stay portable across distros (SteamOS/Bazzite/CachyOS, and future Python
# bumps) we vendor _cffi_backend for EVERY version in LAUNCHER_PYTHON_VERSIONS.
# CPython's import machinery auto-selects the .so whose ABI tag matches the
# running interpreter, so no runtime code change is needed. Versions with no
# published cffi wheel (e.g. a not-yet-released CPython) are skipped with a
# warning. Pure-python files are identical across versions so they're left

# absent from the new zip is never removed - without a prod build

# ── Skip the Decky CLI's redundant binary re-download ─────────
# The CLI downloads every ``remote_binary`` entry from package.json into the
# container on EVERY build - the same ~28 MB of store CLIs that
# ``prebuild_binaries`` already fetched, verified and cached in bin/, and that
# ``_stage_plugin_files`` already copied into the staging dir. It then
# overwrites our copies with byte-identical ones.
#
# That download WAS the single largest cost of a full build. Measured A/B on
# this Deck, same tree, warm caches, minutes apart:
#
#     with the CLI download    320 s total (312 s in the container)
#     without it                47 s total ( 40 s in the container)
#
# 28 MB in 272 s is ~103 KB/s. The same asset fetched from the HOST with curl,
# the same afternoon, came down at 8.7 MB/s - roughly 85x faster. So this is not
# "GitHub is slow to a Deck", as it long appeared to be: it is the container's
# network path. Which is why it never looked like a variable-network problem -
# it was reliably, boringly slow on every single build.
#
# The CLI also has no cache, so it paid that cost whether or not a version had
# been bumped. A bump merely made it visible, because that is the one build
# where prebuild_binaries re-downloads too and you pay twice.
#
# So: strip ``remote_binary`` from the STAGED package.json - a throwaway copy in
# a temp dir - and let the CLI zip the binaries we staged. The repo's own
# package.json is never touched, so the manifest the Decky Store builds from,
# and the CI check that keeps it in sync with this script, are unaffected.
#
# The CLI's download step is also what verified those binaries' checksums, so we
# do it here instead, against the same ``sha256hash`` values from the same
# manifest. If ANY binary is missing or mismatched we leave ``remote_binary``
# alone and let the CLI fetch it the slow way - correctness first, speed second.

# ── Quick-install (dev sync) ──────────────────────────────────
# Fast incremental sync of the working tree into an existing Decky
# install - no zip, no unzip, no Docker. Use this for tight dev
# iteration when you've changed Python or defaults and want them
# live in seconds.
#
# Why this exists: full ``install_plugin`` does a containerised
# build → zip → sudo rm -rf → unzip → chown cycle that can take
# 30s+. ``quick_install`` rsyncs only the runtime payload
# (py_modules, defaults, dist, bin, main.py, plugin.json,
# requirements.txt) and restarts the loader. Sub-second on the
# Deck.
#
# Critically, this includes ``defaults/`` so the source-of-truth
# config can never drift out of the install - the most common
# breakage during manual dev syncs.
#
# Frontend changes still require ``pnpm run build`` first to
# refresh ``dist/index.js``; this script is for backend +
# config + bundled-binary edits where Rollup doesn't need to
# re-run.
#
# Usage: ``./build-plugin.sh dev quick-install``

# ── Publish the dev build to a NEW GitHub release ─────────────
# OPT-IN: this runs only when the ``push`` argument is passed. A plain
# ``./build-plugin.sh dev`` (or ``dev install``) never contacts GitHub. It used
# to publish on every run, which meant a throwaway iteration build silently
# created a remote tag and deleted whatever dev release testers were on.
#
# A pushed dev build gets its OWN prerelease, tagged
# ``Dev-<UTCdate>-<UTCtime>-<shortsha>`` (e.g. ``Dev-20260808-171205-47e6d28``).
# That is how testers get an unreleased build: the in-plugin updater lists
# prereleases in its version picker and installs the ``.zip`` asset.
#
# WHY A NEW RELEASE EVERY TIME, rather than rotating one asset on a fixed
# ``Dev`` tag as this used to: GitHub orders the releases page by a value fixed
# when the release object and its tag are first created. It is NOT the release
# id, and NOT the ``created_at`` the API reports. The old rolling ``Dev``
# release proved it: id 275549827 / created 2026-01-09T16:20:19Z sat *below*
# ``Release-0.4.1`` (id 275410187 / created 2026-01-09T07:53:47Z) despite
# winning on both keys. Neither rotating an asset nor moving the tag can lift a
# release back to the top of the list. Only a brand-new release object on a
# brand-new tag can. So each build creates one, then deletes the previous dev
# release, leaving exactly one in existence at any time.
#
# THE TAG FORMAT IS LOAD-BEARING: it must contain no ``X.Y`` substring.
# ``services/updater/service.py::_parse_version_from_tag`` greps tag names for
# ``(\d+\.\d+(?:\.\d+)?)``, so a tag like ``Dev-0.7.3-g47e6d28`` would parse as
# version "0.7.3" and collide with the real ``Release-0.7.3`` in the updater's
# version picker. A date/time/sha tag has no dots at all, so it falls through to
# that parser's raw-tag branch and sorts below every real release, exactly as
# the literal ``Dev`` tag used to. ``prerelease`` must likewise stay true: it is
# the ONLY field distinguishing a dev row in both the backend and the updater UI.
#
# CREDENTIALS ARE NEVER STORED IN THIS SCRIPT OR THE REPO. Resolution order:
#   1. ``$GH_TOKEN`` / ``$GITHUB_TOKEN`` from the environment;
#   2. the token the git credential helper already keeps in
#      ``~/.git-credentials`` (``credential.helper=store``).
# The value is only ever held in a local, never echoed.
#
# Skipped entirely for: any build without the ``push`` argument (the default),
# prod builds (those go to a real versioned release via the draft flow), CI (a
# runner must not publish tester builds), and whenever
# ``UNIFIDECK_SKIP_DEV_UPLOAD`` is set to anything non-empty - that env var is
# now redundant with the default-off behaviour, but is kept as a hard override
# that still wins over an explicit ``push``.
#
# A missing credential can no longer be shrugged off the way it was when
# publishing was implicit: once ``push`` is typed, failing to publish IS a
# failure. Every hard failure below sets ``DEV_PUBLISH_FAILED``, which makes
# ``main`` exit non-zero AFTER any requested install still runs. The build
# artifact itself is never affected - the zip is already on disk by then.
