"""The shared wrapper-store install watcher.

A wrapper store's install is a user click inside a vendor Windows client that
we neither run nor can measure. All the backend can do is watch the prefix and
decide, from the outside, when the game is there and when the attempt has been
abandoned. Getting that wrong is expensive in both directions: end too early
and a game shows a Play button with no files behind it (which is exactly what
Battle.net used to do, by not watching at all); end too late and an install
that will never finish sits on "Follow the launcher window" for two hours.

The loop is driven with a fake probe and a scripted liveness answer, so these
pin the decisions rather than any store's detection.
