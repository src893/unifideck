"""A wrapper store's prefix is built and driven by the *same* Proton.

Two resolvers decide which Proton touches a wrapper-store prefix:

  * the **launcher's** selector, for every launch of that prefix, and
  * ``UbisoftBinaryResolver``, for the backend-side umu spawns that
    *create* it — the vendor installer, the prefix warmup, the sign-in.

They disagreed. The backend resolver walked a hardcoded display-name
table (``"Proton - Experimental"``, ``"Proton 10.0"``, ``"Proton 9.0
(Beta)"``) that stopped at Proton 10, so on a ROG Ally X carrying Proton
11.0, GE-Proton11-5, GE-Proton10-34, Proton-CachyOS and EM-10.0-34 the
only name it could still match was Experimental. The Battle.net prefix
was therefore created by one Wine build and every client start after it
ran under another, with nobody having chosen either.

The fix has no table in it, which is the point: the plugin-managed
GE-Proton tag is read from the marker the background installer writes.
