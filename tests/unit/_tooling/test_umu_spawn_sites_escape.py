"""Every direct umu spawn must escape Steam's pressure-vessel container.

Field bug (2026-08-12 bundle, twice over): the escape was added to the one
spawn point in ``umu_runtime`` and assumed to cover everything, but four other
call sites built their own ``[python_bin, umu_wrapper, ...]`` argv and handed
it straight to ``create_subprocess_exec``. Under Steam Force-Compat those ran
*nested* inside pressure-vessel and failed:

* ``prefix_init`` — six ``createprefix`` + one ``wineboot --init``, every one
  exit 1 with ``bwrap: execvp true: No such file or directory``, so the prefix
  was never built;
* ``gog_setup`` — nine straight rc=1 (scriptinterpreter + all four
  vcredists), silently leaving the prefix without its redistributables.

The bug is easy to reintroduce: adding a new umu invocation is a two-line
change, and forgetting the escape breaks only Force-Compat, which no
Deck-based test exercises. So assert the property structurally instead.

``escape_argv`` is a no-op outside a container, so the rule costs nothing on
the normal path.
