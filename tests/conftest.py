"""Global test isolation: the toast bridge, and $HOME-redirecting env vars.

``frontend_bridge.EVENTS_FILE`` is a module-level constant pointing at the
REAL ``~/.local/share/unifideck/launcher_events.jsonl``. Any test that
exercises a path calling ``launcher_toast`` — umu retry, compat/prereq
install, store handlers — therefore appended genuine toast events to the
live file. The plugin's *persistent* ``get_launcher_toasts`` poll drains
that file regardless of whether the QAM panel is open, so running the
suite popped real "Retrying Launch — Retrying UMU in 3s (attempt 2/2)…"
toasts into the Steam UI.

That is worse than cosmetic. The file is capped at 100 lines AND is
collected into diagnostic bundles, so a test run silently evicted real
launch history — the exact evidence a bug report depends on. Measured
before this fixture landed: 36 of 79 live lines were test noise.

``tests/unit/test_frontend_bridge.py`` already redirects ``EVENTS_FILE``
for its own cases; this does it for every other test, autouse, so no test
can reach the user's data dir. A test that patches ``EVENTS_FILE``
explicitly still wins — this only guarantees the default is never live.

The second fixture closes a different leak, one that only shows up on
CI. 18 test files build a fake device tree under a scratch dir and point
``HOME`` at it with ``monkeypatch.setenv``. That is not sufficient on its
own: production path resolution deliberately prefers the XDG variables
over ``$HOME`` (``config/user_config_path.resolve_user_config_path``
checks ``UNIFIDECK_USER_CONFIG``, then ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME``, and only then
``~/.config``), so with any of them exported the code under test walks
right past the fixture's fake home to the real one.

GitHub's ubuntu runner image exports ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME``; SteamOS and
the containers we reproduce CI in do not. So the suite passed everywhere
locally and failed only on CI, where
``test_credentials_are_still_audited_as_present`` asserted a token file
it had just written was ``present`` and got ``missing`` — the audit had
resolved ``/home/runner/.config/unifideck/`` instead of the fake home.
Two test files had already worked around this one ``delenv`` at a time;
doing it here covers every current and future HOME-patching test.

Only the variables that *redirect path resolution* are cleared.
``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR``/``XDG_SESSION_TYPE``/``XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`` are
left alone: the support bundle only reports those as diagnostics, and a
test asserting on the environment report should see the real values.

    was mtimes rather than a failing test — a suite run wrote a synthetic
    ``fenris`` row into the live ``battlenet_id_map.json`` and fixture saves
    into ``save_backups/``, hours after the plugin had last been up.

    Reading real user state is bad; *writing* it destroys evidence and, in
    one measured case, signed the machine out of Amazon. This turns the next
    occurrence into a red run instead of a discovery months later.

    ``mount_naming.BY_UUID_DIR`` is a module-level ``Path("/dev/disk/by-uuid")``

    test that builds a synthetic ``/proc/mounts`` naming ``/dev/sda1`` but does
    not pass ``by_uuid_dir=`` reads the REAL host disk index. Whether it then
    gets a name-derived id or a UUID one depends on the machine's partition
    layout, which makes the assertion non-deterministic across hosts.

    That is not hypothetical: ``test_spaced_mount_point_yields_a_path_safe_id``
    passed on both this Deck and a python:3.11 container but failed on CI's
    3.11 runner and passed on its 3.12 runner, because each matrix job gets its

    expected ``ext:External_SSD`` and got ``ext:1f78b26…``.

    Patching ``BY_UUID_DIR`` itself does NOT work: it is bound as a default
    argument at import time (``by_uuid_dir: Path = BY_UUID_DIR``), so rebinding
    the module attribute leaves both defaults pointing at the real dir. What is
    resolved per call is the ``uuid_by_device`` global, so the guard goes there
    and neutralises only the unsafe default: a call that reaches for the real
    ``/dev/disk/by-uuid`` gets an empty map, which is the documented degradation
    for network shares and FUSE mounts and yields the name-derived id.

    Tests that exercise real UUID behaviour pass ``by_uuid_dir=`` a fake index
