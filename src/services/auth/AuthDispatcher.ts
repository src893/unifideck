/**
 * AuthDispatcher — frontend-side auth orchestrator.
 *
 * Owns the full per-store auth handshake end-to-end :
 *
 *   1. ``store_auth(store, "start")`` on the backend so it
 *      creates/refreshes the auth shortcut, writes its
 *      auth-URL file, starts its session monitor, etc.
 *   2. ``launch<Store>AuthViaShortcut()`` so the user actually
 *      sees the browser / launcher (Steam's ``RunGame()``).
 *   3. Subscribes to the backend EventBus
 *      (``STORE_AUTH_COMPLETE`` / ``STORE_AUTH_FAILED``) so
 *      callers can `await` the final outcome.
 *
 * Components / hooks call ``AuthDispatcher.start(store)`` and
 * get a single Promise back. The legacy
 * ``dispatch_unifideck_action("unifideck://auth/<store>")``
 * channel is kept as the way the *backend* talks to itself
 * from toast-action buttons ; UI-initiated connects use the
 * direct ``store_auth`` RPC because that's the only path that
 * returns the per-store ``AuthResult`` we toast on completion.
 *
 * Mutex : only one auth flow at a time. A second `start()`
 * for the same store while another is in flight returns the
 * in-flight promise ; for a different store, it rejects.
