"""utils/mounts.py — shared external-storage mount enumeration.

Centralizes ``/proc/mounts`` scanning that was independently
duplicated in ``rpc/mixins/storage.py``, ``rpc/mixins/download.py``,
and ``utils/paths.py``. The three copies had already drifted:
``download.py``'s skip-list was missing the virtual-prefix check
entirely, ``paths.py``'s skip-list included ``"autofs"`` the other
two didn't, and ``storage.py``'s eligibility check called
``Path.is_dir()`` uncaught — which *raises* ``PermissionError``
(not just returns ``False``) on a mount root is denied access to,
per CPython's ``pathlib`` implementation (which only swallows
``ENOENT``/``ENOTDIR``/``EBADF``/``ELOOP``, not ``EACCES``).

FUSE-mounted external media (NTFS via ntfs-3g, exFAT on some
distros/kernels) are, by FUSE's own security design, invisible to
every UID except the one that mounted them — unless the mount used
``allow_other``, which requires ``user_allow_other`` in
``/etc/fuse.conf`` and is disabled by default.

So whenever the effective UID of this process differs from the UID that
mounted the media, we can neither stat nor validate those mounts: they
need a one-off subprocess demoted to the mount's owning uid, parsed
from the ``uid=``/``gid=`` options ntfs-3g/fuse-exfat mounts carry.
Never ``os.setuid()``/``os.seteuid()`` in this process directly —
glibc's ``setuid()`` is process-wide (synchronized across every
thread), which would be unsafe next to other concurrent async/thread
work in this same backend.

Historical note: this file used to state that the backend "runs as
root (Decky's ``plugin_loader.service`` sets ``User=root``)". That is
no longer true and the demotion logic here does not depend on it —
Decky Loader v3 drops privileges for plugins without the ``root``
flag, and ``plugin.json`` does not set it, so the backend runs as the
desktop user. The ``uid``-demoted probe is still correct and still
needed: it is keyed off the *mount's* owning uid versus ours, which
can differ either way. The support bundle's ``identity`` block records
the live uid/euid, so a future reader can check rather than assume.
