"""services/download/worker.py — Worker loop + install dispatch.

Queue consumer: polls pending queue, enforces concurrency cap,
dispatches each install to the right store via the registry,
emits ``DOWNLOAD_{STARTED,COMPLETE,FAILED}``. Mixin — only
touches host state, no I/O primitives of its own.

Refactor history (2026-05-14): ``_worker_loop`` was a single
async function at CC=16. The locked critical section, the
post-lock dispatch, and the error/cancel envelope were all
inlined, making the main loop hard to scan. Split into two
private helpers so the outer loop reads as
``while: pop → dispatch → sleep``.
