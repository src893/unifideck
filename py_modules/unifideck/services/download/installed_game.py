"""Composing the ``Game`` record for a freshly-installed download.

py_modules/unifideck/services/download/installed_game.py

Split out of ``worker.py`` when that file reached its 550-line cap. It
earns its own module rather than an allowlist entry: nothing here touches
the queue, the running map or the event bus, so it is the one part of the
worker that is pure composition and testable without a service around it.

The record it returns is consumed by
``ShortcutService._on_download_complete`` (which writes the entry into
``shortcuts.vdf`` and ``games.map``) and by
``ArtworkService._on_game_installed`` (which fetches cover art).
