"""services/download/service.py — Central download queue + dispatcher.

Refactor of legacy download/manager.py. Queue accepting install
requests from the frontend, dispatching to the appropriate
``StoreBase`` via ``StoreRegistry``. Polymorphic — no per-store
branching; worker mixin handles the consumer loop.

Persists the queue so pending downloads survive plugin restarts.
