"""services/shortcut/service.py — ShortcutService facade class.

Non-Steam shortcut management. Mutates ``shortcuts.vdf``
(Steam's registry) and ``games.map`` (Unifideck's own exe
manifest read by the launcher wrapper at game-launch time).

Shell class composing multiple mixins:
- ``EventsMixin``       : ``@subscribe`` handlers
- ``_GamesMapMixin``    : typed mutations + queries
- ``_VdfShortcutsMixin``: escape-hatch read/write + auth
                          shortcut delegator

Shell itself owns ``__init__`` / ``stop`` / ``generate_app_id``
and three loaders that pair ``_loaded`` flags with
``persistence.py`` stateless helpers.

        Before writing shortcuts.vdf, re-read the on-disk file and
        merge back any *foreign* shortcut a concurrent writer added
        since our in-memory snapshot was loaded — NonSteamLaunchers'
        scanner service, Steam's shutdown flush, or a manual add. Our
        write is a full read-modify-write of a long-lived cached dict
        (``_shortcuts_loaded`` never re-reads), so without this merge
        it clobbers those entries (UD-043 data loss). Ownership is the
        launcher-``Exe`` gate reconcile already uses: our own entries
        stay memory-authoritative (our deletes are honoured), only
        foreign entries missing from memory are restored.

        The merge is best-effort, though — it can only restore what it
        can identify — so the write is then *checked*: if it would drop
        a foreign entry no caller declared, or the on-disk state could
        not be read at all, the write is refused and the file left
        exactly as it is. See :mod:`write_guard`. Callers that mean to
        remove a foreign-looking row name its appid in
        ``allow_foreign_drops``.

        **Serialised against every other writer of these two files.** The
        merge above defends against a *foreign* concurrent writer; it does
        nothing about two of ours. Both this and the icon pass in
        :mod:`events` do their own read, edit and write, so running
        concurrently they each start from the same snapshot and the second
        discards the first's entries. Worse, they shared one fixed temp path,
        so one write consumed the other's temp file mid-rename: measured
        during a logout as 260 failures in twelve seconds, several leaving
        ``wrote 398 entries but the file holds 0``. The lock covers the whole
        cycle, because guarding only the write would still lose the merge.

        Not reentrant, and does not need to be: every caller of this method
        is a top-level operation (reconcile phases, the games-map mixin,
        startup, the LastPlayTime migration) and none runs inside another.
