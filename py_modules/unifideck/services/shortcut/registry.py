"""Persistent shortcuts registry — ``{store:game_id → appid}`` across restarts.

A single JSON file at ``~/.local/share/unifideck/shortcuts_registry.json``
maps each Unifideck-managed game (``"<store>:<game_id>"``) to the
deterministic Steam AppID we assigned when the shortcut was first
created. The file lives in user data, so it survives plugin
uninstall/reinstall — that's what lets us *reclaim* an orphaned
``shortcuts.vdf`` entry after Steam mangled its LaunchOptions or
tags: we look up the registered AppID and reuse it, preserving the
artwork Steam already cached for that ID.

Ported from ``staging:py_modules/unifideck/shortcuts/shortcuts_manager.py``
(``load_shortcuts_registry`` / ``save_shortcuts_registry`` /
``register_shortcut`` family).
