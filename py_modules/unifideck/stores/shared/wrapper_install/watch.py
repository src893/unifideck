"""Watching a vendor client install a game, for any wrapper store.

py_modules/unifideck/stores/shared/wrapper_install/watch.py

The install itself is a user click inside the vendor's own Windows client. We
do not run it, we cannot measure it, and there is no process of ours to wait
on — the client is started by the frontend through Steam's ``RunGame`` so it
gets a gamescope session and actually renders in Gaming Mode. All the backend
can do is watch the prefix and decide, from the outside, when the game is
there and when the attempt has been abandoned.

This was Ubisoft's, privately, and every constant in it is a scar:

* **Completion is not "the client says so".** Ubisoft has to infer it from the
  install directory's size holding steady, and that fires early on a
  mid-download pause. So a store that *can* answer authoritatively is asked
  first (``InstallProbe.is_complete``) and the heuristic is the fallback, not
  the rule.
* **Never kill the client on completion.** Only on cancel. Because completion
  can be inferred early, killing on it interrupted still-running installs —
  users watched Ubisoft Connect close mid-install and resume on reopen.
* **A tray'd client is not a closed one.** Ubisoft Connect minimises to tray
  during long downloads, so a window probe reports it gone. Liveness is read
  from ``/proc`` instead, which also works in Gaming Mode where a window probe
  is blind to the separate gamescope session.
* **"Never started" needs its own watchdog.** The client-quit watchdog is
  gated on having seen the client, so when it never comes up at all that flag
  stays False and the install burned the full two-hour timeout showing
  "Follow the launcher window" — indistinguishable from a hang. That happened
  in the field: a failed ``RunGame`` (the title missing from ``games.map``)
  left exactly this state.
* **A probe that cannot answer must never end an install.** Every liveness
  failure is read as "alive".

Battle.net used to skip all of this — it reported success the moment its prefix
was placed, so a game showed a Play button before a single byte was downloaded.
