"""What a wrapper store must be able to answer about its own install.

py_modules/unifideck/stores/shared/wrapper_install/probe.py

A wrapper store cannot measure its installs: the vendor's Windows client owns
the download and reports nothing we can read as a percentage. What every one of
them *can* do is watch its prefix and recognise the game arriving. That watching
loop is identical across stores — it is the timeouts, the give-up watchdogs and
the completion rule that took incidents to get right — so it lives once, in
:mod:`.watch`. Only the recognising differs, and this is where a store says how.

Four questions, deliberately no more:

``snapshot``/``detect``
    What was in the prefix before, and has the game appeared since. Ubisoft
    diffs directory listings; Battle.net reads the client's own ``product.db``
    for the uid it asked for, which is both stronger and immune to the
    mis-attribution a directory diff can suffer when a prefix holds two games.

``measure``
    Bytes on disk so far. Feeds the "Installing… (N GB)" tick, and — only for a
    store with no better signal — the completion rule.

``is_complete``
    The store's authoritative "the install is finished", or ``None`` when it has
    none. This split matters. Ubisoft has to infer completion from the install
    directory's size holding steady, and that heuristic is known to fire early:
    a mid-download pause (a chunk being verified, a network stall, a phase
    change) looks exactly like "done". Battle.net does not have to guess —
    ``product.db`` carries ``installed``/``playable``/``update_complete``, and
    all three flip in a single write. A store that can answer is believed; only
    one that answers ``None`` falls back to the heuristic.

And one optional fifth, ``status_message``, which is not about recognising
anything. It is about the wait being legible. A correct 28-minute wait and a
hang look identical from outside, and the store is the only layer that can tell
them apart: Battle.net's Agent runs one exclusive operation at a time and says
so in its own logs, so "Queued behind Battle.net updating itself (88%)" is
knowable while the generic tick can only say "waiting". Optional because a
store with nothing to add should not have to say so: the watcher reads it with
``getattr``, exactly as it reads the optional timing attributes.
