"""Backend session hooks for a wrapper store: capture, and purge on sign-out.

py_modules/unifideck/stores/shared/wrapper_session_hooks.py

``launcher/wrapper_session`` knows *how* to move a session between prefixes.
This mixin decides *when*, on the backend side, and it exists because the
launcher cannot do it alone.

A game launch runs in the out-of-process launcher, which Steam starts and
which can be SIGKILLed with the game — so its own post-run capture is
best-effort, not a guarantee. The backend, by contrast, always sees
``GAME_STOPPED``: the frontend detects the Steam app-state change and bridges
it onto the bus via ``notify_game_stopped``. Capturing there is what makes
"the session survives a play session" true rather than usually-true.

The other two moments only the backend knows about:

* **A prefix is about to be destroyed** — uninstall, or an Install that
  rebuilds. The vendor rotates the token on every run, so a game prefix
  usually holds a *newer* session than the auth prefix; deleting it without
  capturing strands auth on a server-stale token and the next install opens
  signed-out. Ubisoft earned that lesson as a measured incident.
* **The user signed out.** Without a purge, every game prefix keeps a working
  session and the next launch quietly signs them back in.

Generic by construction: a store supplies its id and how to find its
prefixes, and the spec table supplies the rest. Adding a wrapper store is a
row in ``wrapper_session.SPECS`` plus these three small overrides.
