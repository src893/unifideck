"""Battle.net install orchestration — place the prefix, then watch the client.

py_modules/unifideck/stores/battlenet/install.py

Nothing here downloads a game. Battle.net is a wrapper store: the vendor
client inside the prefix owns the download, and the install is a user click
in its window. This module owns the two ends of that — what has to be true
before the click, and knowing when the click's work is done.

**Placement** is the "before". The game installs inside the prefix, so the
prefix's location is the game's location, and Wine derives ``C:``'s free space
from the filesystem under ``drive_c``. Battle.net originally ignored the
storage location the user picked, and the symptom was not a game in the wrong
folder: the client refused an 83 GB install for lack of space, quoting the
45 GB internal drive, while the SD card the user had chosen had 164 GB free.

**Waiting** is the "after", and used to be missing entirely. ``install``
returned success the moment the prefix was cloned, so the download worker
marked the game installed and the tile showed a Play button before the user had
even opened the client. It now blocks on the shared wrapper-store watcher —
the same one Ubisoft uses — and returns the real install directory.

Split out of ``store.py`` when that file hit its size cap. The seam is the
one Ubisoft already uses (``stores/ubisoft/installer/``); the placement policy
lives in ``stores/shared/prefix_placement`` and the watching in
``stores/shared/wrapper_install``.

        the template was re-derived at 22:45, and the next install paid the
        agent update over again with the store back at its 6.9 MB bootstrap
        size. Writing to auth as well means a rebuild inherits the cache
        instead of discarding it.

        The template still gets its own copy, because it is what the *next*
        install clones and a rebuild is not guaranteed to happen in between.

        What makes one copy of that store interchangeable with another is the
        Agent's TACT tag query, not its size. A completed update *shrinks*
        the store, because the Agent compacts away whatever the new tags do
        not select. So the tag string travels with the copy as its generation.

        **An unfinished store is still worth keeping**, and this is the case
        that matters. Users cancel exactly when the wait looks broken, which is
        mid-agent-update; capturing only finished downloads would keep nothing
        on the one path that actually repeats. It is marked partial so a later
        complete capture still supersedes it.

        What is *not* negotiable is that nothing is writing the store as it is
        copied. A torn content store in the template is inherited by every
        prefix made afterwards, which is the one outcome worse than a slow
        install. Note that "the client is closed" is the wrong test for that:
        completion deliberately leaves the window open, so requiring a dead
        client would silently disable the capture on the success path, which
