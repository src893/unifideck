"""Prefix and file-path resolution for the Battle.net store.

py_modules/unifideck/stores/battlenet/paths.py

Unifideck gives every game its own prefix — the deliberate difference from
NonSteamLaunchers, where one shared prefix means one bad client update
takes out the whole library. Battle.net therefore uses the Ubisoft
three-tier layout::

    <prefixes_dir>/.bnet-auth      the user signs into the client here, once
    <prefixes_dir>/.template       pristine, pre-warmed, no games
    <prefixes_dir>/<uid>           one per game, cloned from .template

Two on-device findings shape this module:

* **umu rewrites ``WINEPREFIX`` to ``<prefix>/pfx/`` and creates ``pfx -> .``
  as a self-symlink**, so ``<prefix>/drive_c`` and ``<prefix>/pfx/drive_c``
  are the same directory. Everything here goes through
  ``resolve_drive_c``; combining ``prefix / "drive_c"`` naively is the bug
  that made ``ubisoft_recovery`` fail to find a genuinely present exe.
* A per-game prefix path is **recorded, never reconstructed** from the game
  id. ``prefix_setup.py`` documents a Ubisoft incident where a
  reconstructed path stamped a marker into a directory no launch ever
  opened, causing a permanent reset loop.

    ``Battle.net.exe`` in the client directory is a ~1 MB **shim**: a host
    process that loads the real client out of a sibling
    ``Battle.net.<build>/``. The shim is written long before that payload
    finishes downloading, so the shim alone is not evidence of a client.

    Treating it as such is a measured field failure: a sign-in stopped
    mid-install left the auth prefix reporting "has a client", ``.template``
    was derived from it, every game prefix was cloned from that, and each
    launch started ``Battle.net Launcher.exe`` with nothing to hand off to.
    It exited within seconds and the launch sat out its full 300 s readiness
    timeout — for every title, permanently, with no way to heal it.

    **The payload is keyed on the client DLL, not on an exe.** Measured on
    this Deck, a complete build 17651 payload is::

        Battle.net.exe              1,008,848   <- the shim, one level up
        Battle.net.17651/

            GameSessionMonitor.exe     ~small      the client

    There is no ``Battle.net.exe`` inside the payload dir — the client is a
    DLL. Keying on one made ``client_installed`` return False for every
    correctly installed client, which refused every install with "client
    files are incomplete" and every launch with an unstartable client. The
    advice that error gave ("sign in again") could never fix it, because the
    file it waited for is one Blizzard never writes.

    Keying on the DLL also serves the original purpose better than any exe
    would: the auxiliary exes above are small and land early, while the
    28 MB client DLL lands with the bulk of the payload. The false direction
    stays deliberate — a false "incomplete" costs a client reinstall, a
    false "complete" is the unrecoverable bug above.
