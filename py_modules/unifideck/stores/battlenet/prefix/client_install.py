"""Download and silently install the Battle.net client into a prefix.

py_modules/unifideck/stores/battlenet/prefix/client_install.py

Nothing is bundled. The client is fetched at runtime from Blizzard's own
installer URL and cached, exactly as Ubisoft fetches
``UbisoftConnectInstaller.exe`` — shipping a vendor installer in the plugin
would be both large and stale.

Proven on-device 2026-07-03: the official 4.9 MB stub, run under ``umu-run``
with ``WINEPREFIX`` pointing at a fresh prefix, downloaded and installed the
client and Agent unattended and exited 0.

Two things this must get right or the install hangs rather than fails:

* **Display environment.** The plugin runs headless under
  ``plugin_loader``; a Wine process with no ``DISPLAY`` /
  ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` / DBus hangs. ``WineEnvResolver`` borrows them from
  the live Steam process.
* **The client is 32-bit** (PE32 i386, confirmed on-device). Without a
  32-bit Vulkan driver on the host the installer freezes around 25% with no
  error at all.

That second one used to be a **gate**: a filename guess at the host's Vulkan
ICDs, refusing the install when it came up empty. It came up empty on a
CachyOS machine whose driver Steam had enumerated 42 seconds earlier, and
that user was left with no client, no sign-in and no library — for a
capability they had. So the shape is now:

* :mod:`unifideck.utils.vulkan` answers the question properly, by ELF class
  rather than by filename, and is allowed to answer "I cannot tell";
* **no verdict blocks the install.** Not even ``ABSENT`` — it buys a stall
  watchdog and a warning, not a refusal;
* the hardware-acceleration tweak is written *before* the installer runs
  rather than after, so the stub itself has the best chance of not needing
  the GPU in the first place.

The rule this encodes: never refuse a user the client over a preflight
whose failure mode is a false negative.

    The install path stays pinned: ``wrapper_session_specs`` hashes it to find
    the client's section in ``Battle.net.config``, so it must be the same
    string in every prefix.

    The language does not have to be, and pinning it had a cost beyond an
    English wizard. The bootstrapper derives its **region** from the locale
    (``Configuration: locale=enUS region=US`` in its own log) and warms the
    Agent's content store for that region *before* login. The account's real
    region then arrives at login and invalidates the warm-up, which is a
    45-minute re-download the first time. Guaranteed for every non-US user
    while this said ``enUS`` unconditionally.

    ``bootstrapper_locale`` falls back to ``enUS`` for any tag Battle.net does
    not ship, because the failure mode of a bad value here is the wizard
    stalling on its language screen with no visible window; see its docstring.
