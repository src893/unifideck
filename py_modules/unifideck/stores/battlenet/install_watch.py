"""Recognising a Battle.net install arriving in the prefix.

py_modules/unifideck/stores/battlenet/install_watch.py

The per-store half of
:mod:`unifideck.stores.shared.wrapper_install` — the loop itself is shared with
Ubisoft. What is Battle.net's is that it does not have to *guess* when an
install has finished.

Three facts, all measured, decide the shape of this file:

* **``aggregate.json`` is written early.** During a real 12.43 GB Hearthstone
  install the entry appeared at roughly 40% downloaded. So it answers "the
  client has started writing this game" — which is exactly what
  :meth:`~.BattlenetInstallProbe.detect` wants — and nothing more.
* **``product.db`` is authoritative about completion and useless about
  progress.** ``installed``/``playable``/``update_complete`` all flip in a
  single write, but the completion field sits at 0.0 across 12 GB and the
  total-size field stays 0 until the end. So completion comes from those flags
  and progress comes from bytes on disk — two sources, because neither can do
  both jobs.
* **The join goes through the uid.** ``aggregate.json`` and ``product.db`` are
  keyed on the product CODE (``hsb``); the library addresses titles by uid
  (``hs_beta``). Asking about the code reports every installed game as not
  installed, so this reads through ``library.install_state_by_uid``.

Asking per-uid rather than "is anything ready in this prefix" also means a
sibling Blizzard title finishing can never complete *this* install. That is the
opposite trade-off from ``install.holds_ready_install``, which is deliberately
the broadest possible answer because it guards a deletion.
