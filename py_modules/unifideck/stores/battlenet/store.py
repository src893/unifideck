"""Battle.net store — the ``StoreBase`` implementation.

py_modules/unifideck/stores/battlenet/store.py

A launcher-wrapper store: the real Battle.net Windows client runs inside a
Proton prefix and does the downloading and launching. There is no CLI and
there will not be one — Heroic requires a CLI to exist before adding a
store, and none of the NGDP projects ship a downloader.

Ownership is read from the **client's own local state**, not from the web:
``CachedData.db`` holds the account's licence ids, and the cached PUB
catalog turns them into playable titles by evaluating a small rule
language. The web endpoint (``games-and-subs``) supplies the
``game_account`` facts those rules need for free-to-play and subscription
titles, and is optional enrichment rather than the source of truth.

Consequence: the library is empty until the user has signed into the client
once. That is not a new constraint — install and launch already require it.

Delegation only. Every concern lives in its own module (``ownership/``,
``prefix/``, ``library``, ``id_map``), mirroring the Ubisoft layout.
