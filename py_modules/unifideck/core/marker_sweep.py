"""Marker-based sweep of Unifideck-installed game directories.

OP-58b | py_modules/unifideck/core/marker_sweep.py

Every Unifideck install drops an *ownership marker* in the game folder:

* ``.unifideck-id``            — GOG (carries ``game_id``);
* ``.unifideck_manifest.json`` — Epic / Amazon (carries ``store`` +
  ``store_id``);
* ``.unifideck_ubisoft``       — Ubisoft (carries ``space_id``).

The marker is definitive proof Unifideck created the directory, which lets
cleanup reliably remove games installed to *any* location — including custom
folders and SD-card libraries the store CLIs don't scan — plus orphans left
behind when a store-CLI uninstall removes the game's own files but not our
marker (an empty stub dir). It never touches a folder we didn't create.

Why this exists: GOG resolves a game's install dir by scanning only its
configured ``download_dir``; a game installed elsewhere can't be resolved,
so its uninstall silently no-ops and the full install stays on disk. And
the destructive "Delete all data" only removed dirs recorded in
``games.map``, so orphans accumulated.

Roots are *derived from the install records Unifideck already keeps* (the
store CLIs' ``installed.json`` + ``games.map``) — never a blind filesystem
walk. All functions are synchronous / blocking; call from a thread.
