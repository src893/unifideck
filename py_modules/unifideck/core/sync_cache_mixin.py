"""Library-cache persistence mixin for :class:`SyncService`.

OP-08l-ter | core/sync_cache_mixin.py

Extracted from ``core/sync_service.py`` to keep that file under the
550-LOC volumetry cap. Owns the on-disk ``library_cache.json`` round
trip — loaded once at construction, saved after every finalize and
install-state flip — so a Decky reload restarts with the last synced
library instead of an empty one.

Declares its consumed attributes (``_config``, ``_all_games``,
``_last_sync_time``) as ``TYPE_CHECKING`` annotations only; the host
``SyncService`` provides them at runtime, the same convention the
other sync mixins use.
