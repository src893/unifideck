"""Download RPC mixin for Plugin class.

OP-26i | py_modules/unifideck/rpc/mixins/download.py

Mixin merging two slices that the handler groups split apart:

* per-game lifecycle (``install_game`` / ``uninstall_game`` /
  ``check_game_update``) — these live in ``StoreHandlers`` in
  the newer API;
* download-queue management (``cancel_download`` /
  ``get_download_queue``) — these live in ``DownloadHandlers``.

Storage-location RPCs (``get_storage_locations``,
``set_default_storage_location``, ``set_custom_install_path``)
live in a sibling ``StorageRPCMixin`` (OP-26j); this file only
resolves a chosen storage id to a filesystem path.

Two private helpers centralise the null checks:

* ``_require_store`` — store-not-found errors;
* ``_require_download`` — download-service-unavailable errors.

``_validate_pair`` validates identifiers at the RPC boundary
so the rest of the codebase can treat them as already-sanitised.
