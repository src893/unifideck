"""rpc/mixins/cleanup_finalize.py — post-wipe reset of *live* state.

The disk half of "Delete all Unifideck data" was already correct: shortcuts,
artwork, credentials, prefixes and install dirs all go. What it never did was
tell the running process, so the Downloads tab kept listing games whose files
had just been deleted — reading ``SyncService``'s in-memory ``_all_games``,
which the wipe left untouched — with sizes served from
``installed_disk_info``'s 300-second memo.

This mixin is the missing final step: snapshot what the process still believes
is installed, drop the in-memory library and the size memo, prune the CLI
install records that only become prunable once the marker sweep has run, then
announce each cleared game so the frontend refreshes itself.

Split out of ``sync_cleanup.py`` (515/550 LOC) rather than added to it — the
same volumetry split both that module and ``cleanup_sweeps.py`` document.
Where ``cleanup_sweeps`` holds state-free blocking filesystem passes, this
holds the async orchestration that needs the mixin's collaborators.

        Order is load-bearing:

        1. **snapshot** — must precede the reset, or there is nothing left
           to announce.
        2. **reset + memo clear** — must precede the announce, so
           ``SyncService._on_shortcut_install_state_changed`` finds no
           matching record and returns *before* ``_save_library_cache()``.
           Announcing first would re-persist the library the wipe deleted.
        3. **prune** — must follow ``marker_sweep.sweep_all`` (the caller
           runs it immediately before this), which reads the very records
           being pruned.

        Every step is individually best-effort. ``perform_full_cleanup`` is
        ``auto_wrap``-ed, so a raise here would turn a fully successful wipe
        into an ``internal_error`` envelope and a "Delete failed" toast for
        the user — after their data was already gone.
