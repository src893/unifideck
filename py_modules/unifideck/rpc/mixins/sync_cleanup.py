"""Full-cleanup RPC machinery for :class:`SyncRPCMixin`.

OP-26f-bis | rpc/mixins/sync_cleanup.py

Extracted from ``rpc/mixins/sync.py`` to keep that file under the
550-LOC volumetry cap. Holds the "Delete all Unifideck data" flow —
shortcut removal, grid-artwork wipe, store sign-out, credential
deletion, and cache clearing — plus the small static helpers that
collect the Unifideck-owned app_id set from the persisted shortcut
state. ``SyncRPCMixin`` mixes this in, so the public RPC surface
(``perform_full_cleanup``) is unchanged.

    # into a directory no launch opened, wedging the prefix in a reset loop).
