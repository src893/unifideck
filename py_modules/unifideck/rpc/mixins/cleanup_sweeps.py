"""rpc/mixins/cleanup_sweeps.py — blocking filesystem sweeps for cleanup.

Pure, thread-offloaded helpers extracted from ``sync_cleanup.py`` (which had
crossed the 550-LOC volumetry cap). Each ``sweep_*`` performs one blocking
filesystem pass and returns a deleted-count; :class:`CleanupRPCMixin` calls
them via ``asyncio.to_thread``. Keeping them free of mixin state — and out of
the async methods as un-nested module functions — keeps the mixin's
per-function cognitive complexity under the gate and makes each sweep
trivially testable in isolation.
