# ── Rockstar-on-Epic games (RDR2 / GTA5) ──────────────────────────
# These Epic titles boot the Rockstar Games Launcher, which then runs
# the real game exe (``PlayRDR2.exe`` / ``PlayGTAV.exe``). Getting them
# to launch under Proton/umu needs a bundle of Rockstar-specific
# handling that would REGRESS ordinary Epic titles if applied globally:
#   * STORE=egs (not "none") so umu's protonfixes apply the egs profile;
#   * WINEDLLOVERRIDES=vulkan-1=n,b (the documented RDR2 launch fix);
#   * KEEP the ``com.epicgames.launcher`` registry handler (epic_cleanup
#     strips it for every other Epic game) + a fake EpicGamesLauncher.exe
#     stub beside the game exe, so the game's ``start EpicGamesLauncher.exe
#     PlayRDR2.exe`` handoff resolves without the real Epic launcher.
# Every one of those is gated behind :func:`is_rockstar_egs` so a normal
# Epic launch is byte-for-byte unchanged. Online play never works
# (BattlEye has no Linux support); this is story-mode only.
#
# PRIMARY key = the Epic **app name** (legendary's ``game_id``, e.g.
# "Heather"): it's the one identifier ALWAYS present at launch. The
# umu-database ``umu_id`` is NOT reliable here — it's resolved via the
# optional ``bin/umu_lookup.py`` helper which is not bundled in the Decky
# build, so ``core.proton_prepare`` reports ``umu_id=None`` for every game
# (the reason the first cut of this flow never fired for RDR2 — the gate
# was keyed on umu_id). The umu id is kept as a SECONDARY match only, for
# the case where the lookup helper is present and returns one.

# ── Titles that ship their own ICU and must not get Wine's stub ────
# icuuc=n,b = native-then-builtin, the same shape as the Rockstar
# override above: the game's own icuuc.dll loads first, and Wine's
# builtin is still there to fall back on.
#
# Cyberpunk 2077 bundles ICU **65** as ``icuuc.dll`` beside the game exe.
# From a user log bundle (2026-08-12, SteamOS desktop, Unifideck 0.7.3),
# every launch that reached the game died on the same line, via BOTH
# ``REDprelauncher.exe`` and a direct ``Cyberpunk2077.exe`` retry:
#
#   wine: Call from 00006FFFFFF5C8C0 to unimplemented function
#         icuuc.dll.u_setMemoryFunctions_65, aborting
#
# The game got as far as vkd3d device creation and Fossilize, then
# aborted — so the window opens and stays blank. Wine loaded its BUILTIN
# ``icuuc.dll`` ahead of the game's, and that builtin is a stub.
#
# Which Proton builds carry that stub, checked on-device:
#
#   GE-Proton9-26   builtin icuuc.dll: no    bundled ICU: none
#   GE-Proton10-10  builtin icuuc.dll: no    bundled ICU: icuuc68.dll
#   GE-Proton10-34  builtin icuuc.dll: no    bundled ICU: icuuc68.dll
#   GE-Proton11-1   builtin icuuc.dll: no    bundled ICU: icuuc68.dll
#   GE-Proton11-3   builtin icuuc.dll: YES   bundled ICU: icuuc68.dll
#
# GE-Proton11-3 is the first build to ship it, which is why this surfaced
# now. Proton's own bundled ICU is **68**, so it cannot serve an ICU-65
# symbol either — bumping Proton is not the fix, loading the game's own
# copy is. protonfixes cannot cover this: there is no gamefix for this
# title in any store's directory, and nothing in the protonfixes tree
# touches ICU at all.
ICU_NATIVE_WINEDLLOVERRIDES = "icuuc=n,b"
# PRIMARY tier = the exe name, for the same reason it is primary for
# Rockstar: it survives re-releases and is identical on every store.
# ``REDprelauncher.exe`` also fronts The Witcher 3 next-gen, which is

# icuuc.dll of its own, so the worst case is a no-op override.

    "umu-1091500",  # Cyberpunk 2077
})
# THIRD, most-durable match tier: the Rockstar Play-launcher exe name itself
# (lowercased). Rockstar/Take-Two re-release these titles under a NEW Epic
# app id every edition — legacy "Grand Theft Auto V"
# (9d2d0eb64d5c44529cece33fe2a46482) and the 2026 "Enhanced Edition"
# (8769e24080ea413b8ebca3f1b8c50951) are two different ids for what a user
# experiences as "the same game" — and ROCKSTAR_EGS_APP_NAMES above silently
# stops matching every time that happens.
#
# That is exactly what broke the Enhanced Edition (reported as: the Rockstar
# Games Launcher doesn't detect the installed game). Confirmed from a user
# log bundle that contains a clean A/B of both titles on one device:
#   * RDR2 ("Heather", in the allowlist) — 10 launches, each logging the full
#     flow: fake launcher installed, protocol registered, STORE=egs,
#     WINEDLLOVERRIDES+=vulkan-1=n,b.
#   * GTA V Enhanced (id absent from the allowlist) — 12 launches, NONE of
#     the above; the game log shows protonfixes falling back to
#     "No store specified, using UMU database" instead of the egs profile.
# So this title received none of the Rockstar handling at all.
#
# NOTE: the reporter also described it working on the first boot and failing
# after a restart. The per-boot mechanism for that is NOT established — the
# obvious suspect, epic_cleanup stripping the registration on later launches,
# is NOT supported by those logs (it never logged a removal for this game,
# and it only logs when it actually removes something). Treat the
# first-boot/restart asymmetry as unexplained; what IS proven is that the
# whole flow was skipped for this title.
#
# The Play-launcher exe names are a Rockstar Games Launcher contract that is
# edition-independent, so this is checked FIRST, ahead of the id allowlists.
ROCKSTAR_PLAY_EXE_NAMES: frozenset[str] = frozenset({
    "playrdr2.exe",
    "playgtav.exe",
})
# FOURTH tier — the ``Play<Title>.exe`` convention itself, for Rockstar titles
# we have no id or exact exe name for yet (GTA III/VC/SA Definitive Edition,
# GTA IV Complete, the RDR1 port…). Rockstar-on-Epic builds ship a
# ``Play*.exe`` bootstrap that chain-loads the Rockstar Games Launcher's
# ``Launcher.exe`` from the SAME directory — the ordering visible in a real
# game log (``PlayGTAV.exe`` → ``Launcher.exe`` → ``SocialClubHelper.exe``).
#
# BOTH signals are required, and that is deliberate. A false positive here is
# not harmless: it would flip an ordinary Epic title to STORE=egs, whose
# ProtonFixes profile adds the HKCR\\com.epicgames.launcher key that pushes
# the EOS SDK into launcher-IPC auth → instant exit/hang (see
# _epic_store_value and tests/unit/test_proton_prepare_store_env.py). A lone
# "starts with Play" match would be far too loose to risk that.
#
# UNVERIFIED: the two titles we have hard evidence for (GTA V Enhanced, RDR2)
# are both already covered by the exact-name tier above, so this tier is
# inferred from Rockstar's packaging convention rather than observed. It can
# only ADD coverage — every verified title still matches earlier, cheaper
# tiers — but the specific titles above need a tester who owns them to
# confirm. Once confirmed, prefer adding the exact name/app id above.
