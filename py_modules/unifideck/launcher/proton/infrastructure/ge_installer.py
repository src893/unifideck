"""launcher/proton/infrastructure/ge_installer.py — Latest GE-Proton fetch/install.

Downloads and installs the newest GE-Proton release from GitHub
(``GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom``) into Steam's
``compatibilitytools.d`` so games default to the *latest* GE-Proton
released online, not merely the newest copy already on disk.

Used from two processes:

* the plugin (Decky's Python) on startup — background, non-blocking,
  via ``ProtonService.start`` → ``asyncio.to_thread``;
* the launcher (system Python) as a launch-time safety net inside
  ``selector.select_proton_version``.

Every network/disk failure is swallowed and surfaced as ``None`` so
the caller can fall back to Proton Experimental. Only the stdlib is
used (``urllib`` / ``tarfile`` / ``json``) — the slim launcher has no
third-party HTTP client.

    winetricks/regedit compat steps) hangs its wineserver forever — a
    broken auto-updated Proton-Experimental build did exactly this and
    wedged the serial install queue.

    Checks the load-bearing pieces of a Proton tool directory:

    * the ``proton`` launcher script is present **and executable**
      (mirrors :func:`installed_ge_proton_path`'s "present AND
      ``os.access(X_OK)``" guard — a survived-partial-extract copy is
      left non-executable);
    * a ``files/`` subdir (the Wine/runtime payload) exists and is
      non-empty, with the Wine loader (``files/bin/wine``) present —
      the payload a hung wineserver needs and the piece a truncated
      extract most often lacks;
    * a readable, non-empty ``version`` marker;
    * a readable, non-empty ``toolmanifest.vdf``. umu parses this file
      before it launches anything (``CompatLayer.__init__`` does
      ``vdf.load(f)["manifest"]``) and guards only ``is_file()`` — so a
      TRUNCATED, zero-byte manifest sails through umu's own check, then
      ``vdf.load`` returns ``{}`` and the ``["manifest"]`` lookup raises an
      unhandled ``KeyError: 'manifest'``. That aborts the launch with a
      bare traceback and no actionable message. It is a real field failure
      (umu-launcher#706, where upstream traced it to a 0-byte manifest in
      the reporter's own Proton copy), and we download GE-Proton
      ourselves, so a partial download lands squarely in it. Rejecting the
      build here makes it fail *selection* instead, which drops through
      the existing ladder to Proton Experimental.

    NB: a zero-byte ``dist.lock`` is *not* a corruption signal —
    every official Steam Proton tool ships one as its normal per-tool
    lock, so it is deliberately not checked here.

    Best-effort and conservative: any unreadable/unexpected state is
    treated as *incomplete* so the caller degrades to a known-good
    Proton rather than risk a hang.
