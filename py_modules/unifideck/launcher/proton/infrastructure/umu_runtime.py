    Why umu's own ``.installed.ok`` marker is deliberately NOT accepted as an

    whether an install *finished*: the two answer different questions.

    * ``.installed.ok`` (written only when ``check_runtime`` validated the

    broken entry point. umu would decline to reinstall it (marker present)
    and then fail to exec it — the precise wedge this repair exists to break,

    The reverse mismatch needs no handling: a runtime with an entry point but

    before its LAST step — creating the ``umu -> _v2-entry-point`` symlink
    (umu's ``_install_umu`` does that in a ``finally``) — leaves a runtime
    that umu's own ``_update_umu`` treats as "up to date" (it only checks
    the platform dir / pressure-vessel / VERSIONS.txt, never the entry
    point). The next launch then dies in ``build_command`` with
    ``FileNotFoundError``, which umu exits with a code OUTSIDE our
    ``_RECOVERABLE_CODES`` (0 when the bundled zipapp swallows it, 1 when a
    field build re-raises) — so ``run_umu_with_retry`` never retries or
    wipes, and the user stays wedged.

    Deleting just the broken variant dir lets umu re-download it cleanly on
    the next ``umu-run`` this same launch; healthy sibling variants are left
    untouched (surgical). Cheap — one ``stat`` per existing variant — and a
    no-op on a healthy runtime, so it is safe to call on every launch. Safe
    without locking: launches run serially and this runs before any umu
    process is spawned, so no concurrent umu holds ``umu.lock`` here.

    ONCE PER VARIANT PER TTL. The repair assumes umu can re-download what we
    delete, and that assumption is only as good as the bundled umu.

    It was FALSE up to umu 1.4.1, which fetched from
    ``repo.steampowered.com/<variant>/images/latest-public-beta[/VERSION.txt]``
    — ``latest-*`` symlink paths the repo answers with HTTP 403 (numbered
    version dirs still return 200). umu's *update* path treats a 403 as
    non-fatal and keeps the runtime it already has, but its *install* path
    RAISES, so once a variant was gone it could never come back; re-deleting
    the stub umu left behind merely spun, and field logs showed this fire
    three times in a single launch.

    The bundled umu (>=1.4.3) reads ``images/latest-public-beta.txt`` and
    fetches from the numbered directory that file names, which serves
    normally — so a wipe is now genuinely recoverable and this guard is no
    longer working around a dead endpoint.

    The single-attempt rule stays anyway, because "umu cannot install this
    runtime" has other causes (no network, full disk, a future repo change).
    It is a loop breaker, not a 403 workaround: after one failed repair we
    leave the variant alone and let :func:`unrecoverable_runtime_variants`
    turn it into a real error rather than an infinite silent retry. The TTL
    is deliberately short so a transient cause self-heals on the next launch.
