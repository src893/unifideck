"""Escape Steam's pressure-vessel container before spawning umu.

Unifideck shortcuts point their ``Exe`` at ``bin/unifideck-launcher``, a
native Linux script that selects and drives Proton itself via umu. When the
user sets Steam's own **Properties > Compatibility > "Force the use of a
specific Steam Play compatibility tool"** on such a shortcut — which is a
supported, intended workflow: that is how the user tells us which Proton
they want, and the launcher reads it back via
``selector.get_steam_compat_tool_override`` — Steam ALSO wraps the launcher
itself in its own Steam-Linux-Runtime pressure-vessel container before
spawning it.

Everything the launcher then does happens *inside* steamrt, and Proton's own
``python3`` cannot resolve ``libz.so.1`` there::

    python3: error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1:
    cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

umu exits 127. Reproduced deterministically on-device by entering the
container exactly as Steam does
(``SteamLinuxRuntime_4/_v2-entry-point --verb=run --``) and running the
identical umu command: the interpreter reported by umu flips from the host's
``3.13.5 (main, Jun 21 2025) [GCC 15.1.1]`` to the container's
``3.13.5 (main, May 5 2026) [GCC 14.2.0]``, and the launch dies. Escaping and
re-running the *same* command succeeds (rc=0, ProtonFixes + ntsync reached).

``UMU_NO_RUNTIME=1`` does NOT help — verified; the failure is Proton's own
interpreter inside steamrt, not merely umu nesting a second container.

The fix is to hop back out via ``steam-runtime-launch-client
--alongside-steam``, which runs the command in the Steam client's own
context outside the container. Verified on-device:

* the escaped process gets a clean HOST environment (host ``PATH``, no
  ``container``/``PRESSURE_VESSEL_*``/``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` leakage), plus
  Steam's display/audio session vars — which is exactly why
  ``--alongside-steam`` is used rather than ``--host``;
* exit codes propagate verbatim (checked with a deliberate ``exit 42``);
* killing the client reaps the escaped child, so the launcher's existing
  Stop / cancel / timeout teardown keeps working.

This makes the launch correct **whether or not** Steam wraps us, so the user
can freely switch Proton builds in Steam's own picker to find one that works
for a given game — no clearing of their selection required.

    process's** filesystem. Inside pressure-vessel that is the *container's*
    ``/usr/bin``, whose Python need not exist on the host we are about to
    escape to. From a user bundle (2026-08-12, SteamOS desktop): the
    container offered python3.13, the host had only 3.14.6, so every
    Force-Compat launch died in 0.0s with rc=127 and a game log of nothing

    Both prelauncher attempts and the direct-exe retry failed the same way,

    support — was unusable on that machine.

    escape client a ``sh`` shim that walks the SAME candidate list and execs
    the first interpreter that is actually executable there. No probing of
    ``/run/host`` (not guaranteed to be mounted) and no extra round-trip.
