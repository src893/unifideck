"""compat/prefix_init.py — synchronous prefix creation + proton-change reset.

Runs once at the start of every Windows launch, before the compat
steps and the game. Two jobs (ported from staging's launcher
prefix-init block):

1. **Proton-change reset.** Each prefix records the Proton tool that
   built it (``.unifideck_proton_version``). When the resolved Proton
   *family* changes — the user switched Force Compatibility, unselected
   it (falling back to the latest GE-Proton), or moved between
   Experimental ↔ GE ↔ Proton 9/10 — the old Wine prefix is
   incompatible, so we back up its user data, wipe it + the setup
   markers, and toast ``protonUpgrade``/``resettingPrefix``. A
   same-family bump (e.g. GE-Proton10-10 → 10-34) keeps the prefix
   (Proton upgrades it in place) and just toasts ``protonSwitchedTo``.
   **Stores that install the game INSIDE the prefix are never reset** —
   see :func:`_prefix_owns_game_install`.

2. **First-time init.** If the prefix has no ``system.reg`` it isn't a
   usable Wine prefix yet, so we run ``umu-run createprefix`` (with
   retry) and toast ``firstTimeSetup``/``initializingPrefix`` →
   ``setupCompleteTitle``/``prefixInitialized``, falling back to
   ``wineboot --init`` (``setupFallback``) if createprefix doesn't
   produce a ``system.reg``.

Entirely best-effort: any failure is logged and the launch proceeds
(the game's own first umu run still initialises the prefix, exactly as
before this step existed).

    Compatibility (``Proton-GE Latest``). Matching raw substrings got both
    directions wrong, and each mistake is expensive — a false family change

    From a field bundle (2026-08-12/13) where one GOG prefix was reset six

    change that was missed, because ``proton-ge latest`` and
    ``proton-cachyos latest`` both failed every check and collapsed to

    Between attempts this used to call ``cleanup_umu_runtime_cache()``,
