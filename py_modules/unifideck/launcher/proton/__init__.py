    registry fix, with the managed-GE recovery ladder + pin) are NOT done

    (Phase 1.5), before the cloud sync-down, so the save dir resolves out of
    ``drive_c`` on the first launch and the exact same self-healing setup runs
    at launch as at install-time warmup. Running compat here too would
    double-run it (and its proton-change toast), so it lives in the single
