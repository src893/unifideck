"""Install the Battle.net client into a prefix, and say why when it fails.

py_modules/unifideck/launcher/proton/handlers/battlenet_bootstrap.py

Runs **here**, inside the RunGame session, rather than in the backend. The
rule is the one ``services/download/wrapper_signals.py`` already states: the
backend must not spawn the vendor client itself, because in Gaming Mode a
bare subprocess has no gamescope session and its window never appears. It
applies to the client's *installer* too — that is exactly how this failed
once. Signing in from the desktop showed the wizard; from Gaming Mode it
rendered nowhere, and the sign-in RPC blocked on a window nobody could see.

Split out of ``handlers/battlenet.py`` when the reason for a failure started
mattering as much as the fact of one. The old code reduced a structured
``BootstrapResult`` to a bare ``False``, so a user whose install was refused
over a (wrongly) undetected 32-bit Vulkan driver was told *"Battle.net Not
Installed — reinstall the game to rebuild it"*: not the reason, and not
something they could act on. The mapping below is the fix, and the reason
this module returns the result rather than a boolean.

Stdlib-and-launcher imports only, deliberately verified to load under the
SYSTEM python (3.10-3.14) that runs this process.
