"""Locating the Battle.net client and resolving launch codes.

py_modules/unifideck/launcher/proton/handlers/battlenet_client.py

Runs inside the out-of-process launcher, under the SYSTEM python (3.10 to
3.14), so this is stdlib-only and must not import the plugin backend.

Two things it deliberately does not do:

* **It never combines ``prefix / "drive_c"`` directly.** umu creates
  ``pfx -> .`` as a self-symlink and both layouts occur in the wild; the
  naive combine is what made Ubisoft's recovery path fail to find a
  ``upc.exe`` that was genuinely present.
* **It never derives a FAMILY from a uid by transformation.** The two are
  unrelated namespaces (``fenris`` -> ``Fen``, ``hs_beta`` -> ``WTCG``) and
  Blizzard renames families, so the mapping is read from the id map the
  backend writes. A wrong family fails *silently*.

    ``Battle.net.exe`` beside the launcher is a ~1 MB **shim**: a host
    process that loads the real client out of this directory, and the
    bootstrapper writes the shim long before that payload finishes
    downloading. An install interrupted in that window leaves a prefix that
    passes every "is the client here" check and cannot start — measured in
    the field, where it poisoned the auth prefix, the template derived from
    it and every game prefix cloned from that, so each launch burned the
    full 300 s readiness timeout and no amount of signing out repaired it.

    Keyed on the client DLL (``battle.net.dll``), NOT on an exe: the payload
    dir holds no ``Battle.net.exe`` at all — the client is a DLL, beside
    ``libcef.dll`` and ``Battle.net.mpq``. Its only exes are the auxiliary
    ``BlizzardError.exe`` / ``GameSessionMonitor.exe``. Keying on an exe
    reported every correctly installed client as incomplete, which refused
    every install and made every client unstartable.

    The backend states the same rule in ``stores/battlenet/paths.py``
    (:func:`client_payload_dir`). It is written twice on purpose: this
    module runs in the out-of-process launcher under the SYSTEM python and
    must not import the plugin backend. ``test_battlenet_paths_config``
