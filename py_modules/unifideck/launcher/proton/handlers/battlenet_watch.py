"""Process observation for the Battle.net two-phase launch.

py_modules/unifideck/launcher/proton/handlers/battlenet_watch.py

Everything here runs on the **Linux side**, reading ``/proc``. That is a
deliberate anti-cheat hygiene rule, not incidental: Warden scans the game
process's memory, its loaded code, the Windows process list and its handle
table. Reading ``/proc/<pid>/cmdline`` and ``/environ`` touches none of
those — it never enters the prefix, never opens a handle to the game, and
never appears in the Windows process list.

Two measured facts shape the probes:

* **There is no ``Battle.net Helper.exe`` process.** That string is a
  command-line *argument*; every CEF child is named ``Battle.net.exe`` and
  distinguished by ``--type=``. An earlier design keyed readiness on a
  process that does not exist.
* **The client's ``WINEPREFIX`` is ``<prefix>/pfx/``**, because umu
  normalises it and creates ``pfx -> .`` as a self-symlink. Prefix matching
  must therefore normalise, or a client running for a sibling Blizzard game
  is mistaken for this one's.

The ``/proc`` primitives themselves now live in ``wrapper_clients``: they are
not Battle.net-specific, and the question that motivated moving them — "is a
client already running in some *other* prefix" — cannot be asked from a
module whose every function takes one prefix.
