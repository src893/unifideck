"""Battle.net launch handler — two-phase, with post-launch verification.

py_modules/unifideck/launcher/proton/handlers/battlenet.py

Launching a Battle.net game is not one command. The client must already be
running before it will accept a launch instruction, so::

    Phase A  start Battle.net Launcher.exe, DETACHED
             PROTON_VERB=waitforexitandrun — this run owns the wineserver
    Phase B  poll until a CEF renderer exists in THIS prefix
    Phase C  Battle.net.exe --exec="launch <FAMILY>"
             PROTON_VERB=run  <-- load-bearing, see below
    Phase D  verify a game process actually appeared
    Phase E  watch until it exits

**Phase C must use ``PROTON_VERB=run``.** ``waitforexitandrun`` runs
``wineserver -w`` first, which blocks until the prefix's existing wineserver
exits — and in phase C that wineserver is the client we just started.
Measured on-device: with ``waitforexitandrun`` the second invocation never
reaches the exe at all and the command never lands; with ``run`` it works.

**Phase D is mandatory, not defensive.** Blizzard renamed Diablo IV's family
code ``D4`` -> ``Fen`` in 2026, and the client *accepts the obsolete code and
does nothing* — no error, no dialog, no exit code. The only way to know a
launch worked is to see a new game process. For the same reason the phase C
return code is ignored: the client forwards the command and exits, so its rc
says nothing about the game.

Only one argument is passed. NonSteamLaunchers issue #957 reports a shortcut
opening the launcher instead of the game while passing both ``--exec`` and a
``battlenet://`` URI; the conflicting second argument is a prime suspect.
