"""The gamescope-WSI workaround: measured per host, never assumed.

py_modules/unifideck/launcher/proton/handlers/battlenet_wsi.py

The Battle.net client's CEF renderer uses **ANGLE**, and on some hosts
ANGLE's device creation trips an assertion inside gamescope's Vulkan WSI
layer::

    [Gamescope WSI] Application info:
      pApplicationName: Battle.net.exe
      pEngineName: ANGLE
    [Gamescope WSI] Forcing on VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1.
    vkroots.h:129: … insert(Object, DispatchPtr) [with Object = VkQueue_T*]:
    Assertion `obj' failed.

A null ``VkQueue`` reaching the layer's dispatch table. The Wine session
dies and umu still returns 0, so nothing upstream looks like an error.

**It is host-specific, and that is the whole design constraint here.**
Measured 2026-08-19 on two machines running the *same* SteamOS 3.8.25
(build 20260807.2), the *same* kernel 6.18.42-valve2 and the *same*
gamescope 3.16.23.5:

===============  ==================  ==========
Device           GPU                 Client
===============  ==================  ==========
Steam Deck       Van Gogh 1002:163f  works
ROG Ally X       Phoenix 1002:15BF   aborts
===============  ==================  ==========

So the fix cannot be an unconditional ``DISABLE_GAMESCOPE_WSI=1``.
Disabling the layer costs the XWayland-bypass path — direct scanout, HDR —
and not only for the client: the game is started *by* the client and
inherits its environment, so every Blizzard title on every healthy host
would pay for a bug it does not have.

Hence: **react, never predict.** The first launch on an affected host runs
normally, fails in ~30 s (the readiness wait notices the client is gone),
and only then is the game log consulted for the signature above. If it is
there, the workaround is recorded for this host and the launch is retried
immediately. Every later launch reads the marker and applies it up front.

Deliberately *not* keyed on the GPU id. A hardware allowlist is the same
mistake as the 32-bit-Vulkan filename probe that refused a user their
client on a machine that had the driver: the failure mode of a guess is a
false negative, and the failure mode of measuring is one slow launch, once.

The marker is **host-scoped**, not per-prefix: this is a property of the
graphics stack, and a per-prefix marker would re-pay the 30 s discovery for
every game the user installs.

Stdlib-only; runs under the SYSTEM python (3.10-3.14).
