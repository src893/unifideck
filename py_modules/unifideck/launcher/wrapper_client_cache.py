"""Carry a vendor client's expensive-to-rebuild cache back to the template.

py_modules/unifideck/launcher/wrapper_client_cache.py

Sibling of :mod:`wrapper_session`, and the same shape of problem one step
along: that module moves what proves *who* the user is, this one moves what a
client would otherwise have to re-download to be *usable*. Both exist because
a per-game prefix is an rsync clone of ``.template`` and everything the clone
learns dies with it.

The measured case. Battle.net's Agent runs one exclusive operation at a time,
and on a fresh prefix it makes its own self-update that operation, so the
game's download waits behind it. That costs two seconds when the local content
store already holds the build's tagged content, and 45 minutes when it does
not. The user sees a bar reading "Queued" and cancels; cancelling deletes the
prefix; the next attempt re-downloads the same bytes from zero. Three attempts,
three restarts, no progress ever made.

Nothing here prevents that first download. What it prevents is paying for it
more than once.

**Replace, never merge, and the size is not the signal.** The obvious design
was "copy when the source holds more", and measuring it killed that outright:
after Battle.net's Agent finished updating, its store was 5.4 MB against the
template's 6.9 MB. The Agent *compacts* on completion (``[casc] Starting
Compaction``), discarding content the new tag set does not need. So the smaller
store is the correct one, and the bigger one is stale. Size cannot tell them
apart, and an additive merge would be actively dangerous: these stores are an
``indices/`` directory describing archives under ``data/``, so blending two
generations leaves an index pointing at archives that are not there. The whole
tree is swapped, or nothing is.

**The generation string is what decides.** The caller passes an opaque token
identifying what the source store satisfies, for Battle.net the Agent's TACT
tag query, e.g. ``Volatile Windows KR? acct-IND? geoip-IN?``, and it is
recorded in the marker. A capture is skipped when the template already carries
that generation. Opaque on purpose: this module has no business parsing a
vendor's tags, only comparing them.

**Content stores only, never installed programs.** ``client_cache`` must never
name an extracted binary tree: a half-applied client copied into ``.template``
would be inherited by every prefix created afterwards, turning a slow install
into a permanently broken store. Battle.net's entry is ``Agent/data`` and
deliberately not the ``Agent/<build>/`` beside it.

**Quiescence is the caller's call, not this module's.** Copying a content store
while its writer is mid-flight can capture a torn index. Only the store knows
when its client is done. For Battle.net that is
``agent_status.self_update_finished``, so the decision stays there. Same
reasoning that keeps ``holds_game`` out of ``stores/shared/prefix_placement``.

Stdlib-only; runs under the SYSTEM python (3.10-3.14) like everything in
``launcher/``. Best-effort throughout: this runs beside a cleanup the user is
waiting on and must never be the reason it does not happen.
