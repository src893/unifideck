"""What a wrapper store's session consists of, per store.

py_modules/unifideck/launcher/wrapper_session_specs.py

The data half of session propagation; ``wrapper_session`` is the behaviour
half. Split because they change for different reasons and at different rates:
the mechanism is stable, while these declarations track whatever a vendor
client happens to do this release.

**What is generic is the mechanism; what lives here is the evidence.** A
generic guess about which files constitute a session, or about what a
signed-out prefix looks like, would be exactly the mistake the guards exist to
prevent — the same reason ``stores/shared/prefix_placement`` refuses to own
``remover``/``holds_game``. Adding a store is a row in :data:`SPECS`.

Measured Battle.net layout (client build 17651, 2026-08-11).

**The login token is a registry key, not a file.** That is the single fact
that makes this work, and getting it wrong is why a first attempt shipped a
session the server answered with ``ERROR_TOKEN_NOT_FOUND (49)``. The client's
own log says it plainly: ``BattleNetLogin::DeleteToken(): Deleting registry
token``. The keys live in ``user.reg`` under ``Software\\Blizzard
Entertainment\\Battle.net\\`` — ``UnifiedAuth`` (the token),
``EncryptionKey``, ``Identity``. Those are exactly the three names the
``stores/battlenet/prefix/manager.py`` docstring recorded from its on-device
experiment; searching for them under ``AppData`` finds nothing because they
were never files. ``launcher/wine_registry`` moves them.

It is also why a whole-prefix ``rsync`` clone opens signed in: it carries
``user.reg``. Any copy that moves only the client's files cannot.

The files that travel with the token, and why each is classified as it is:

    AppData/Local/Battle.net/Account/<accountid>/account.db
        128 KB fixed size, fully encrypted; 12 of its 32 pages differed
        between the auth prefix and a prefix whose client had run. Rotates
        with the session, but is not the token itself. Fixed size means a
        shrink test — Ubisoft's logout signature — cannot work here.
    AppData/Local/Battle.net/BrowserCaches/{common,<accountid>}/
        CEF cookie jars: bnet.pam, bnet.extra, web.id, JSESSIONID, login.key.
        The web half of the session.
    AppData/Local/Battle.net/CachedData.db
        NOT the token, and never evidence: its ``login_cache`` and
        ``key_value_store`` were identical across a rotation, and
        ``battlenet/store.py`` documents the licence ledger as surviving a
        sign-out. Carried for ownership freshness only.
    AppData/Roaming/Battle.net/Battle.net.config
        Not session material, and never copied **as a file**. It is the
        client's settings file, and it travels key by key instead: see
        :class:`PrefsSpec` and ``launcher/wrapper_prefs``.

**The settings file is per-prefix, and that was a bug of its own.** Every game
gets its own prefix, so the launcher's own settings live in whichever prefix
the user happened to change them in and reach no other. The reported symptom
was a language setting that "reverts to default every time you launch a game":
not a clobber, an absence of propagation. Measured layout (same client build)::

    {
      "Client": { "GaClientId": ..., "AutoLogin": ..., "Toasts": {...},
                  "Version": { "LastBuildVersion": "17651", ... },
                  "Install": { "DefaultInstallPath": "C:/Program Files (x86)" } },
      "5a61123b37cafce1": {                    # hash of the client install path
          "Client": { "Language": "enUS", "LoginSettings": {...} },
          "Path": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Battle.net",
          "Services": { "LastLoginRegion": "US", ... } },
      "Games": { "d1": { "LastPlayed": ..., "LastActioned": ... } }
    }

Two things about it are worth writing down, because neither is guessable:

* **The launcher's language is** ``<install-hash>.Client.Language``, not
  ``Client.Language``. The hash covers the client's install path, which
  ``client_install.INSTALLER_ARGS`` pins to ``C:\\Program Files (x86)\\
  Battle.net``, so it is the same string in every one of our prefixes
  (verified: ``5a61123b37cafce1`` in the auth prefix, the template and a game
  prefix). A store that let the install path vary would get a second section
  here rather than a merge conflict.
* **The client rewrites the whole file from memory when it starts.** A game
  prefix's config was observed carrying a ``LastPlayed`` from a session nine
  hours older than the file's own mtime. So a write that lands while the client
  is up is discarded without error, exactly the hazard
  ``wine_registry.registry_is_writable`` exists for. Preferences are written
  only into a prefix with no live client.
