"""Propagating a wrapper store's signed-in session between Wine prefixes.

py_modules/unifideck/launcher/wrapper_session.py

A *wrapper store* runs a vendor client inside the prefix
(``launcher/wrapper_stores.py``), and that client keeps its session **inside
the prefix it ran in**. Unifideck gives every game its own prefix, so a
session earned once has to be moved: pushed *out* to a prefix before its
client starts, and pulled *back* after that client exits, because the vendor
rotates the token on use and the copy every other prefix holds goes
server-stale the moment it does.

Ubisoft learned this the hard way and solved it privately under
``stores/ubisoft/session/``. Battle.net then copied Ubisoft's three prefix
tiers but none of the lifecycle, and shipped the same bug: measured on this
Deck on 2026-08-11, ``.bnet-auth`` and ``.template`` were byte-identical and
frozen at 08:57, while the game prefix's client had rewritten every session
file at 21:15 — twelve hours of rotation that never came back. The user saw
``BLZBNTBGS80000023`` ("Your login session has expired") on every install and
launch.

So this is shared rather than copied, for the reason ``prefix_placement``
states: the same question asked separately in two places is how these stores
break. Adding a store is a :class:`SessionSpec` row.

This module is the **behaviour** half. What a session consists of, per store,
lives next door in ``wrapper_session_specs`` — including the measured
Battle.net layout and, most importantly, the fact that its login token is a
**Wine registry key** rather than a file. Getting that wrong is why a first
attempt shipped a session the server answered with
``ERROR_TOKEN_NOT_FOUND (49)``: the files arrived and the token did not.
``launcher/wine_registry`` moves the keys.

Stdlib-only, and deliberately **outside** the ``proton`` package for the same
reason ``wrapper_stores`` is: it is imported both from
``launcher/proton/handlers/`` and from ``stores/``, and reaching it through
``proton`` pulls in ``proton/__init__`` -> handlers -> ``types/context``, a
cycle. Runs under the SYSTEM python (3.10-3.14), not Decky's bundled 3.11.
