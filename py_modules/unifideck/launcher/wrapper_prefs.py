"""Propagating a wrapper store's launcher *settings* between Wine prefixes.

py_modules/unifideck/launcher/wrapper_prefs.py

The smaller sibling of ``wrapper_session``, and the same shape of problem. A
wrapper store runs a vendor client inside the prefix, Unifideck gives every game
its own prefix, and the client keeps **both** its session and its settings in
whichever prefix it ran in. ``wrapper_session`` moves the session. Nothing moved
the settings, so the reported bug was a launcher language that "reverts to the
default every time you launch a game": each game's client had its own copy of
the settings file, and a change made in one reached no other.

Three things make this a separate module rather than more of ``wrapper_session``:

* **It is a merge, not a copy.** The settings file is per-prefix *and* shared:
  the same JSON holds the user's language next to this prefix's install path and
  this game's ``LastPlayed``. Copying the file corrupts the second kind. So the
  copy is key by key, minus a denylist the store declares in
  :class:`~unifideck.launcher.wrapper_session_specs.PrefsSpec`.
* **The session's ordering rule is the wrong rule.** ``inject`` refuses when the
  source's session is not newer than the target's, and the auth prefix's token is
  routinely *older* than a game prefix's because the game prefix rotated it last.
  Gating settings on that would skip the merge in the normal case, which is the
  bug. Settings are ordered by their own file's mtime instead.
* Volumetry: ``wrapper_session`` is near the file cap.

**Newest change wins, with the auth prefix as the hub.** A prefix that just ran
merges its settings back to auth on teardown; a prefix about to run takes auth's
on the way in. Both legs refuse to write over a *newer* destination, and that
refusal is load-bearing rather than an optimisation: the launcher can be
SIGKILLed (the Steam stop button and the QAM "X" both take that path), so a
capture can be missed, and without the guard the next launch would push auth's
stale settings back over the change the user had just made locally.

Deciding what the *plugin* should put in that file in the first place is the
neighbouring concern, and lives in ``wrapper_locale``: this module carries
whatever the user changed, that one seeds the UI language. They meet only in
``wrapper_session.inject``, which seeds and then merges. ``wrapper_locale``
imports this module for its JSON helpers, so the dependency runs one way and
nothing here may import it back.

Stdlib-only, and it must not import ``wrapper_session`` - that module imports
this one. Runs under the SYSTEM python (3.10-3.14), not Decky's bundled 3.11.
