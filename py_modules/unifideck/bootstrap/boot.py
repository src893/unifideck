"""bootstrap.boot — full plugin cold-start orchestration.

Runs exactly once when Decky Loader loads Unifideck. The
ordering below is load-bearing:

  Layer 2 (core) → Layer 4 (stores) → Layer 5 (services)

Services subscribe to the EventBus in their ``__init__``, so the
event topology is only live after the bootstrap step.

Boot sequence (each step must complete before the next):

  0. Startup migrations — one-time renames/rewrites of on-disk
     state left behind by older versions (see
     ``bootstrap.migrations``). Runs before anything else touches
     disk so a migrated file is already in place the first time a
     store or config layer reads it.
  1. ``EventBus`` instantiation — empty, no pipeline yet
  2. Pipeline construction — watchdog + latency + replay +
     batcher + dispatcher, with dispatcher.start() awaited
  3. ``CacheManager`` instantiation pointing at the data dir
  4. Cache name registration (``register_default_caches``) —
     MUST happen before stores are discovered because store
     constructors may call ``is_available()`` which reads
     from the cache
  5. ``ConfigManager`` with 3-layer merge (defaults + user + code)
  6. Config validation — marks plugin as degraded on failure but
     never prevents boot
  7. ``StoreRegistry`` + ``SyncService`` instantiation
  8. Store auto-discovery — scans ``stores/`` for connectors
  9. Layer-5 services bootstrap via ``ServiceContainer``
  10. ``start_async_services`` — kicks off long-lived service
      workers (cloudsave, download queue, etc.)

Mutates the plugin in place. Never raises.

            stub out the XDG/env resolution without monkey-patching.

    Never raises: validation failures flag degraded mode and

    the ServiceContainer itself and leave the failed service
